# Neuroverse: Adaptive VR for Neurodivergent Empathy

This project explores adaptive sensory filtering and profile blending in shared VR experiences between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Built in Unity using C# and deployed on Meta Quest 3.

## 🧠 Features

- Sensory calibration and profile prediction using ML
- Real-time filtering (audio, visual, motion)
- Shared user blending engine
- GDPR-compliant anonymous data collection
- Modular Unity-based architecture
