# Neuroverse: Adaptive VR for Neurodivergent Empathy

> 🌍 A VR platform that adapts to individual sensory needs — connecting neurodivergent and neurotypical users through shared, empathetic interaction.

This project explores adaptive sensory filtering and profile blending in shared VR experiences between neurotypical and neurodivergent individuals. Built in Unity using C# and deployed on Meta Quest 3.

## 🧠 Features

- Sensory calibration and profile prediction using ML
- Real-time filtering (audio, visual, motion)
- Shared user blending engine
- GDPR-compliant anonymous data collection
- Modular Unity-based architecture
